      </p>The Georgetown Center of Econometric Practice (GCEP) is an initiative of the Georgetown Center of Economic
      Research located in the Economics Department at Georgetown University.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to improve the quality of economic policy debate by increasing the level and practice of
      econometric knowledge in the DC economic research and policy communities. To do so we are partnering with the
      Center of Microdata Methods and Practice (<a href="http://www.cemmap.ac.uk/">CEMMAP</a>) to provide a number of
      activities. These will range from training courses covering the fundamentals of econometric analysis to
      masterclasses taught by experts working on the frontier of econometric research.</p>
