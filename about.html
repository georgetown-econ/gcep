      <p>The Georgetown Center of Econometric Practice (GCEP) is an initiative of the Georgetown Center of Economic
      Research located in the Economics Department at Georgetown University.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to contribute to the economic policy debate by increasing the quality of the econometric
      knowledge and practice in the DC economic research and policy communities. To do so we are partnering with the
      Center of Microdata Methods and Practice (<a href="http://www.cemmap.ac.uk/">CeMMAP</a>) to provide a number of
      activities. These will range from training courses covering the fundamentals of econometric analysis to seminars
      and masterclasses taught by experts working on the frontier of econometric research.</p>
