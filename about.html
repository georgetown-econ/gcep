      <p>The Georgetown Center for Econometric Practice (GCEP) is an initiative of the Georgetown Center for Economic
      Research (<a href="http://gcer.georgetown.edu/">GCER</a>) located in the Economics Department at Georgetown University.</p>

      <p>Our mission is to contribute to the economic policy debate by promoting the knowledge and practice of
      econometrics among the DC economic research and policy communities. To do so we are partnering with the Center of
      Microdata Methods and Practice (<a href="http://www.cemmap.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CeMMAP</a>) to provide a number of
      activities. These range from training courses covering the fundamentals of econometric analysis to seminars
      and masterclasses taught by experts working on the frontier of econometric research.</p>
